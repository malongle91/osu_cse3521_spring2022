    "# CSE3521 Midterm Part2 \n",
    "\n",
    "## Name: Malong Le (.482)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the second part of the midterm and it is meant to give you an opportunity to do a proper linear regression analysis on some interesting data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data can be found here:  https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009. The goal of this analysis is to the various properties of the wine to explain it's ultimate \"quality\" using a linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A couple of comments:\n",
    "In general, what I'm looking for here is an interesting analysis and interpretation of the results. I leave the conclusions up to you but I would like a coherent and thought out conclusion/story from your analysis.\n",
    "- You are free to look at what other people on the internet have done (kaggle/stack overflow/etc) and try to synthesize parts into your own analysis. However, all conclusions and interpretations should be your own.\n",
    "- You are *NOT* allowed to discuss with your classmates.\n",
    "- You are welcome to try combining techniques (for example doing PCA on the data or making new variables from the ones that already are there) to try to improve your regression model.\n",
    "- You are welcome to use any packages you want BUT be sure to use them correctly! Don't make errors by not reading the docuumentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to get the most marks \n",
    "##### First, if you make an honest attempt using just the items we covered in class, you'll already get most of them -- so don't panic! More details below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the model comparison techniques we learned in class to fit what you be believe is the \"best model\".\n",
    "- Strong and compelling visuals, tables and analysis go a long way in convincing your audience about the results of your analysis. Use them. Don't just show a table of the regression output from statsmodels and call it a day.\n",
    "- Take a look at the summary statistics of the variables (feel free to use helper functions -- for example check out pd.describe in the pandas package).\n",
    "- Interpret the coefficients you find important to the model. If you use PCA/SVD/other methods (definitely not required but may be interesting to do),  be sure to explain what the new data means and how it was used.\n",
    "- In general, I won't give more credit to a model with slightly higher accuracy BUT I also won't give credit where no effort was made to fit a good model (duh!). For example, if you just fit the average with no covariates -- that probably isn't the best approach.\n",
    "- One of the things we didn't cover in great depth was testing that the final regression line fits the assumptions of linear regression (for example, one of the assumptions is that the error terms are normally distributed). Check these assumptions for your final model and interpret them. The point of this is to have you read something new from other sources and figure out how to incorporate it into your own work.\n",
    "- When you get to a final model, specify what features you ended up using and how you came to that decision. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Rules\n",
    " - Be SURE to UNDERSTAND something if you use it. Don't just copy and paste blindly.  For example, if you use cross-validation, that's great! Just use it appropriately.\n",
    " - Write a conclusion regarding what you found. Be sure to outline the strengths, weaknesses, what else you might want to do in a potential future analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "All tests for significance below will use the level, **P-Value = 0.05**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Perform a single variable linear regression for each variable, taking note of the variables that **are insignificant** (Large P-Value).\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Start with a multi-variable linear regression for all the variables that were significant in Step 1 above.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. One-by-one, identify insignificant variables and perform a new linear regression without them, until the **only variables remaining are significant** (Low P-Value).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identify Redundant Variables (correlated with each other) to eliminate.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. From the **correlation matrix** of the raw data, see if any of the significant variables remaining are correlated or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. If significant variables are correlated, eliminate the variable with **less significance** in the linear regression model."

    "## Here, we declare our final model and interpret each coefficient.\n",

    "Based on our linear regression analysis, we are left with the following model for wine quality:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Wine Quality = 4.2957 - 1.0382 * Volatile Acidity - 2.0023 * Chlorides\n",
    "                - 0.0024 * Total Sulfur Dioxide - 0.4352 * pH\n",
    "                + 0.8887 * Sulphates + 0.2907 * Alcohol`\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the **literal interpretation** of each of the following model coefficients:\n",
    "1. When all of the variables (volatile acidity ... alcohol) are set to 0, the Quality starts at a value of 4.2957.\n",
    "2. For every additional unit of Volatile Acidity, the Quality decreases by -1.0382.\n",
    "3. For every additional unit of Chlorides, the Quality decreases by 2.0023.\n",
    "4. For every additional unit of Total Sulfur Dioxide, the Quality decreases by 0.0024.\n",
    "5. For every additional unit of pH, the Quality decreases by 0.4352.\n",
    "6. For every additional unit of Sulphates, the Quality increases by a factor of 0.8887.\n",
    "7. For every additional unit of Alcohol, the Quality increases by a factor of 0.2907.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken at **face value**, this model implies that Volatile Acidity, Chlorides, Total Sulfur Dioxide, and pH all \"worsen\" the wine quality as they grow, while Sulphates and Alcohol \"improve\" the wine quality as they grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we must remember **not to extrapolate** this model to variable levels above and below the extremes of our testing data.\n",
    "+ For example, we can not confidently predict the quality of a wine with a volatile acidity level above 1.58, which was the maximum volatile acidity level of the data given.\n",
    "\n",
    "The high **F-statistic** of the model (147.4) and low corresponding P-value (7.12e-149) provides strong evidence that there indeed exists a significant relationship between these variables and wine quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the moderately-low **adjusted R^2 value** (0.355) implies that only 35.5% of the variability in the wine quality is explained by these variables. This indicates that these variables cannot explain the full picture of why wine quality varies, so it would be useful to explore more factors of wine that correlate with quality."

    "From the coefficients alone, we found higher levels of **Volatile Acidity, Chlorides, Total Sulfur Dioxide, and pH** to correspond to **worse** wine quality, while we found higher levels of **Sulfates and Alcohol** to correspond to **better** wine quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this model is **constrained by the ranges** of these variables that we sampled from the data, and this model is **far from perfect** in **explaining all the variability** in wine quality, with a not-so-inspiring adjusted R^2 value of 0.355.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assumption checks in Part 3 indicated that **linear regression would work for this data**, but it leaves a slight uncertainty about whether the residuals of the model are actually normally distributed.\n",
    "+ At an intuitive glance, some of the \"good\" variables correlating to better wine quality like Sulphates could, in reality, be in a situation where a \"moderate\" amount would result in good quality, but \"too much\" may be a bad thing. Since this model is linear, it would not be able to detect such trends in that case.\n",

    "Meanwhile, we found instances of **significant variables** in the model being **correlated with each other**, which causes concerns for **inaccuracy from multicollinearity** when keeping all the significant variables, or **loss of fit information** when dropping some of these significant variables.\n",
    "+ Ultimately, of the significant variables, I decided to **drop only Free Sulfur Dioxide** because of its correlation to Total Sulfur Dioxide.\n",
    "+ Another potential concern (but one I chose to ignore) might be the correlation between **Chlorides and Sulphates**, which have a moderately-weak relationship according to their R value, 0.371.\n",

    "Based on all the following limitations of this model, I would recommend the **following improvements** to the model with more time and resources:\n",
    "1. Use sophisticated techniques for **dimensionality reduction** (PCA, ZCA) to eliminate redundancy from multicollinearity in groups of variables like Total and Free SO2, while still maintaining the useful  information that they provide.\n",
    "2. Play around more with **single variable models** to see if any variable might actually have a **non-linear relationship** with quality. If so, then use techniques to fit non-linear models onto the data.\n",
    "3. Find **other competitive** linear models with **different combinations** of the same variables to compare this existing model to. Create various subsets of test data to see how successful the competing models are in prediction, based on their mean-squared-error values."
